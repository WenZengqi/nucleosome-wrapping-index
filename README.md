# nucleosome-wrapping-index

As shown in Fig. 1a, to calculate the NRS (nucleosome wrapping score) for a genomic interval (e.g., a 10 kb bin), we first counted the length of all the DNA fragments mapped within that interval. Then we separated the DNA fragment into two groups by a fragment length “break point (bkp)” X bp. NRS is computed as the relative deviation between the number of fragments within X-250 bp (represented by variable “a”) and the number of fragments within 50-X bp (represented by variable “b”), expressed as NRS(X) = (a-b)/(a+b). For example, if the “break point” is 140bp, then NRS(140) is computed as the relative deviation between the number of DNA fragments within 140-250 bp (longer ones) and the number of DNA fragments within 50-140 bp (shorter ones). Thus, larger NRS value indicates DNA wraps tighter on nucleosomes; smaller NRS value indicates DNA wraps looser on nucleosomes.
